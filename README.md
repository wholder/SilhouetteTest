# SilhouetteTest
**SilhouetteTest** is an experimental, Java Language-based program I created to learn how to use the [**Usb4Java**](http://usb4java.org) library to connect to and control a [**Silhouette Curio**â„¢](https://www.silhouetteamerica.com/shop/silhouette-curio-products).  I've included code for other Silhouette cutters, but I've only tested the code with the Curio and the USB I/O values used to connect to these other cutters is only based on information I gleaned from other, similar projects on the Internet and is likely to be incorrect, or insufficient.  Please see the notes in the source code for more details.

I created and tested SilhouetteTest using [**IntelliJ Community Edition 2017**](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=mac) on a Mac Pro and did some further testing on Windows 10 (using Parallels) and Linux Mint.  The code should work on the Mac without further configuration, but there are some additional setup and configuration steps needed before it will run on Windows or Linux (see comments in the source code for additional details.)
### Purpose of this Project
I have another project called [**LaserCut**](https://github.com/wholder/LaserCut) that is a CAD-like program for creating and cutting 2D designs on a Laser Cutter, such as the Epilog Zing.  I'm using this test code to experiment with and learn how to control the Silhouette devices and to eventually add support for them into my LaserCut program.  I also thought that other programmers who want to learn how to control Silhouette cutters, or other USB devices might find it useful as a reference.
### Usb4Java
**SilhouetteTest** uses Usb4Java to communicate with the USB-based Silhouette cutters.  For convenience, I have included the Usb4Java libraries in this project, but you should check for newer versions, as I may not update this project once I've accomplished my goal of added code into LaserCut to directly drive the Silhouette cutters.

#### Information Wanted
If anyone owns a Mac and any of the other Silhouette cutters, such as the Cameo (original, V2 or V3), Portrait, etc., you can help me determine the USB I/O parameters for these other cutters using SilhouetteTest.  There is a [**runnable JAR file**](https://github.com/wholder/SilhouetteTest/tree/master/out/artifacts/SilhouetteTest_jar) included in the checked in code that you can download.  Just double click the SilhouetteTest.jar file and it should start and display a window like the one shown near the top of this page.  _Note: you may have to select the SilhouetteTest.jar file, right click and select "Open" the first time you run the file to satisfy Mac OS' security checks.  Then, select "Run Scan" and click the "RUN" button.  If it can identify a Silhouette-made device, it will display text like this:

      Bus: 000 Device 027: Vendor 0b4d, Product 112c
        Interface: 0
          BLK add: 0x01 (OUT) pkt: 64
          BLK add: 0x82 (IN)  pkt: 64

Please copy this text, along with the full model name and version of your device, and post it in the Wiki Section listed above.
